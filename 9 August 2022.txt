12:30AM meeting Mahima, Nikhil
Told me to perform weekly report on live support
Also told me to call Viresh STL & ask him what is the problem in PPAP-PFD
Tell him to share his scrren to see actual issue
He told me that issue is solved, PFD is saving after 15min
Sometimes it gets saved instantly or sometimes it requires time to save
Told the update to Mahima
Also shared the photos of report created
