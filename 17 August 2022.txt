12:00 PM meeting Mahima, Nikhil
Shared 1st file to her to check if correct
again messaged her that change in file regarding date format 
date format is mm:dd:yyyy and not dd:mm:yyyy
Again she sent new DB & told to check and share list which raw material code doesn't exist
She told to check code using like in sql
Also told her if raw material code not exist we can't do only step 4 i.e. notification method table
After 6pm she told me to send the scripts but there was correction in files
She told that we have to do today only
So worked on these...have to send scripts which have raw material code
